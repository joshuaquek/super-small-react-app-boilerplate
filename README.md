# Super Small React Boilerplate
Another simple ReactJS app boilerplate. 

## Installation
Make sure that you have NodeJS installed.

Only on the first time before you run the app, you would need to download all of the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Running:

### To run in development mode:
```
npm start
```

### To run in production:
```
npm run prod
```
This exports it as a static site and uses `http-server` to server the static bundled webapp

### Exporting the static webapp:
To simply export it as a static webapp to be served elsewhere using your own webserver:
```
npm run export
```

In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
